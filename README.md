# animation using direct manipulation
### inspired by a demo i saw once

- don't try to run this on anything BUT and iPad Pro, it straight up won't work
- it only supports a hardcoded 10 seconds right now, don't expect that to change anytime soon
- code is heinous because honestly i'm going to rip it out in a week
- gl finding the play/pause button
- timeline scrubbing _sometimes_ works?
